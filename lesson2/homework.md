1. What do you understand by
. O(n)
. O(1)
. O(log n)
That for the input of size n the solution take less then n/1/log n operations/storage to compute. 
Or in more matemtical ways: time(solution()) <= time(n/1/log n + c), where c is some constant and time measure how long program takes, and can be replaced with memory(), for memory complexity.

2. Which of those is best when describing a proof size
The best possible proof size would be O(1) in starknet it its 

3. In your teams discuss why are there few identity projects on Starknet ?
4. In preparation for future lessons you need to install Protostar
